Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

1. Objective: Predict survival probabilities of Titanic passengers based on various factors such as age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.

2. Dataset: Utilized the Titanic dataset containing information like survival status, ticket class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin number, and port of embarkation.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - Checked for null values and addressed them appropriately.
   - Filled missing values for age based on the passenger's ticket class.
   - Filled missing values for the embarked port using the mode.
   - Dropped the cabin column due to a high percentage of null values.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualized survival rates using Seaborn's countplot.
   - Analyzed survival based on gender and ticket class using countplots.
   - Explored relationships between variables like siblings/spouses aboard and ticket class using countplots.

5. Data Preparation:
   - Converted non-numeric columns (sex) to numerical values using one-hot encoding.
   - Dropped irrelevant columns like name, ticket, and embarked port.

6. Model Building:
   - Built a logistic regression model to predict survival probabilities.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split method.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and classification reports.
   - Explored other models like K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Decision Tree for comparison.

7. Model Evaluation:
   - Compared training and testing accuracies, precision, recall, and F1-scores for each model.
   - Identified Random Forest as the best-performing model with a testing accuracy of 82.03%.

8. Conclusion:
   - The Random Forest model demonstrated the highest testing accuracy, indicating its robustness in predicting survival probabilities.
   - The project showcases the application of machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and make predictions, with potential real-world applications in risk assessment and decision-making.

9. Future Improvements:
   - Explore feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
   - Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize model parameters further.
   - Deploy the model in a production environment for real-time predictions.
